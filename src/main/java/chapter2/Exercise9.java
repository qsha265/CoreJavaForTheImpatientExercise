    /* Question
    Implement a class Car that models a car traveling along the x-axis, consuming gas as it moves.
    Provide methods to drive by a given number of miles, to add a given number of gallons to the
    gas tank, and to get the current distance from the origin and fuel level. Specify the fuel
    efficiency (in miles / gallons) in the constructor. Should this be an immutable class?
